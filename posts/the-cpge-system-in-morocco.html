            <h2>The CPGE system in Morocco</h2>
<p>It is 5:30 AM on a cold November Tuesday in Rabat, or perhaps Fez, or Marrakech. The city is still sleeping, wrapped in that peculiar, damp Atlantic chill. But inside thousands of small, cramped rooms across the Kingdom, the lights are already on.</p>
<p>Young men and women are waking up, washing their faces with cold water, and sitting down to stare at a sheet of paper covered in hieroglyphics that would make a normal person weep. They are calculating the eigenvalues of a matrix or parsing a philosophical text by Hegel. They are fueled by cheap instant coffee, parental pressure, and a terror so specific it has its own vocabulary.</p>
<p>These are the <em>Taupins</em>. The students of the <em>Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles</em> (CPGE). And if you want to understand the modern Moroccan soul—its ambition, its brilliance, its neuroses, and its deep, systemic fractures—you do not look at the Parliament. You look at a math class in Lycée Moulay Youssef.</p>
<p>I am writing this not as an academic study, but as a love letter and a lament to the most rigorous, effective, and brutal educational system ever devised. It is a system that saves us, and it is a system that is slowly killing us.</p>
<h3>The Golden Ticket</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the truth, because we agreed to be honest. In a country where social mobility often feels like climbing a greased pole, the CPGE is the one elevator that actually works.</p>
<p>If you are the son of a mechanic in Errachidia, or the daughter of a teacher in Tiznit, and you have a brain that works like a microprocessor, the "Prepa" is your way out. It doesn't care who your father is. It doesn't care if you have connections ("Pistons"). The math problem on the board does not respect your last name. It only respects the solution.</p>
<p>This is the "Voie Royale"—the Royal Way. It promises that if you surrender two (or three) years of your life to absolute, monastic discipline, you will be granted entry into the nobility of the Engineer. In Morocco, "Ingénieur d'État" is not just a job title. It is a social rank. It sits somewhere between a doctor and a minor deity.</p>
<p>There is a profound dignity in this meritocracy. I have met young engineers who came from mud-brick houses and are now designing solar grids or running financial systems in Casablanca. To deny the power of this machine is to deny the hope of millions.</p>
<h3>The Napoleonic Ghost</h3>
<p>But here is where we must apply our British skepticism and ask: "Yes, but at what cost, exactly?"</p>
<p>The CPGE system is a French import. It was designed by Napoleon to churn out officers, bridge-builders, and cannon-makers for the Empire. It is a system designed to select the obedient, the resilient, and the computationally swift.</p>
<p>We imported this system, planted it in North African soil, and watered it with our own cultural anxieties.</p>
<p>The result is a pressure cooker that borders on the inhumane. We take our brightest, most creative 18-year-olds—kids who should be reading poetry, falling in love, making mistakes, and playing bad music—and we lock them in a room for two years to do integral calculus.</p>
<p>We tell them that their worth as human beings is directly correlated to their ranking in the "Concours National Commun" (CNC). We teach them that life is a zero-sum game: for you to win, someone else must lose.</p>
<p>This is a bit problematic, actually.</p>
<p>It creates a "Tunnel Vision" of intelligence. We begin to believe that being smart means being good at math. We devalue the artist, the writer, the entrepreneur, the chaotic thinker. I have seen brilliant minds crushed in the Prepa not because they weren't smart, but because their intelligence was divergent. They didn't fit the mold of the Napoleonic cannon-maker.</p>
<h3>The "Colle" and the crushing of the Ego</h3>
<p>If you want to see a scene of medieval torture adapted for the modern age, observe a "Colle" (oral exam).</p>
<p>A student stands at a blackboard. A professor sits behind them. For one hour, the student must solve a problem while the professor dissects their reasoning, their posture, and sometimes, their will to live.</p>
<p>I am not exaggerating. I have seen grown men cry over a physics equation.</p>
<p>Now, the defenders of the system (and they are many, and they are loud) will say: "This builds character! This teaches you to think under pressure!"</p>
<p>And they are right. It does. If you can survive two years of CPGE, you can survive anything. A corporate boardroom is a holiday camp compared to a math oral at Lycée Mohammed V.</p>
<p>But there is a thin line between building resilience and inflicting trauma. When we teach young people that "failure" is a moral defect rather than a learning opportunity, we create a workforce that is terrified of risk. We produce incredible <em>solvers</em> of problems, but very few <em>finders</em> of problems. We produce managers, not disruptors.</p>
<p>We are churning out technical excellence, absolutely. But are we churning out free thinkers? Or are we creating high-functioning conformists who are too exhausted to question the status quo?</p>
<h3>The Human Cost of "The Rank"</h3>
<p>Let’s talk about the ones who don't make it.</p>
<p>In every class, there is a ranking. First to last. The dignity of the student at the top is celebrated. But what about the dignity of the student who works 16 hours a day and still finishes 25th?</p>
<p>In our culture, we don't handle this well. We treat the "5/2" (the student who repeats the second year to improve their rank) with a mix of pity and respect. But the one who drops out? The one who cracks? They are the "Victims of the Prepa."</p>
<p>We need to say this clearly: <strong>Your rank in a math exam is not your value as a human being.</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like a cliché, but in the hallways of these schools, it is a radical heresy. We need to stop looking at our youth as resources to be mined for GDP. They are not oil wells. They are people.</p>
<p>I worry about the mental health crisis in these institutions. It is the elephant in the room that everyone sees but no one feeds peanuts to. The sleep deprivation alone is enough to qualify as a Geneva Convention violation. We normalize the idea that suffering is a prerequisite for success. "No pain, no gain" is a gym motto, not an educational philosophy.</p>
<h3>The Brain Drain (The Great Tragedy)</h3>
<p>And then, there is the final irony. The cruelest joke of all.</p>
<p>We put these kids through hell. We filter them, polish them, and turn them into diamonds of analytical ability. And what happens to the very best of them?</p>
<p>They go to France. Polytechnique (X), Centrale, Mines-Ponts.</p>
<p>And they stay there.</p>
<p>We are running the world's most efficient export business of high-IQ gray matter. We invest millions in their education, we break their backs with work, and then we gift them to the French economy. It is a tragedy of colonial proportions.</p>
<p>But can we blame them? If a young woman feels that her country only values her for her ability to pass an exam, but does not offer her a society where she can breathe, create, and live with dignity... why would she stay?</p>
<h3>A tasty Tagine of Hope</h3>
<p>So, am I saying we should burn the CPGEs down?</p>
<p>No. That would be foolish. You don't tear down a cathedral just because the pews are uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The CPGE system teaches a rigorous intellectual honesty that is rare in today’s world of "fake news" and "AI slop." It teaches you that truth is hard to find, that you must prove your work, that you cannot bluff gravity. This is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>But we need to season this tagine. It is too dry. It needs the moisture of compassion.</p>
<p>We need to introduce the humanities not as a "distraction" but as a core survival skill. An engineer who knows thermodynamics but doesn't understand history is a dangerous person. An engineer who can solve a differential equation but cannot empathize with the user of their product is a bad engineer.</p>
<p>We need to tell the students: "Look, this is a game. Play it hard. But do not let it eat your soul. Do not let the rank define you. The world is wider than the CNC."</p>
<h3>Conclusion: To the Student Awake at 5 AM</h3>
<p>If you are reading this, and you are one of them—eyes red, hands stained with chalk, terrified of tomorrow’s <em>Colle</em>—listen to me.</p>
<p>You are doing something incredibly difficult. You are walking through fire. I respect that. The country respects that.</p>
<p>But remember this: The universe is not a linear system. It is chaotic, messy, and beautiful. You cannot solve life like you solve a matrix.</p>
<p>When you finish this—and you will finish it—take a breath. Look up from the paper. Look at the sky. Remember that you are a person first, and a <em>Taupin</em> second.</p>
<p>The future of Morocco does not depend on your ability to integrate a function. It depends on your ability to integrate your intelligence with your humanity.</p>
<p>We need you. But we need <em>all</em> of you. Not just the part that does math.</p>
<p>Now, go drink some water. You’ve got this. And if you don't? The sun will still rise over Rabat tomorrow, and it will be beautiful. That is the one variable that never changes.</p>
