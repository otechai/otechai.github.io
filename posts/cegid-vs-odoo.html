        <h1>Why a Picture Frame Manufacturer Uses Cegid</h1>
<p>So Medidis is a Kenitra-based furniture and decoration manufacturer making picture frames, mirrors, moldings, furniture, and mattresses - and they're running their operation on Cegid while Odoo exists.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why this pisses you off, and why it's actually a perfect snapshot of Moroccan industrial mindset.</p>
<h2>The Real Problem: It's Not About the Software</h2>
<p>Here's what you're seeing: a 400+ employee manufacturing company with 30,000 sqm of factory space, exporting worldwide to Europe, Middle East, and USA, using expensive-ass Cegid ERP when they could run their entire operation on Odoo for a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>You're thinking: "Why the hell would a furniture manufacturer need Cegid? This isn't aerospace engineering. It's picture frames and mattresses!"</p>
<p>And you're absolutely right. But you're also completely missing the point.</p>
<h2>The Bureaucratic Manufacturing Mindset</h2>
<p>Let me paint you the real picture of how decisions get made at companies like Medidis:</p>
<p><strong>The Decision-Making Chain:</strong><br />
1. Owner/Board says "we need better systems"<br />
2. CFO asks "what do similar companies use?"<br />
3. Someone mentions "Cegid, SAP, Oracle"<br />
4. They call 3 big consulting firms<br />
5. Firms propose Cegid because it has the fattest commission<br />
6. Decision made. Nobody even Googles "alternatives"</p>
<p><strong>Why Odoo Never Enters the Conversation:</strong></p>
<p><em>Finance Director</em>: "We need an ERP for production planning."</p>
<p><em>IT Guy</em>: "What about Odoo? It's‚Äî"</p>
<p><em>Finance Director</em>: "Does it have references in furniture manufacturing?"</p>
<p><em>IT Guy</em>: "Well, yes, but we'd need to‚Äî"</p>
<p><em>Finance Director</em>: "Can you call them at 3am when production line stops?"</p>
<p><em>IT Guy</em>: "We could set up support but‚Äî"</p>
<p><em>Finance Director</em>: "Get me proposals from Cegid, SAP, and Microsoft."</p>
<p><em>End of discussion.</em></p>
<h2>The Real Reasons (Beyond the BS)</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>The Liability Shield</strong></h3>
<p>When your production line stops and you're losing ‚Ç¨10,000/hour, having a big vendor to blame is worth the premium.</p>
<p>With Cegid:<br />
- "The vendor is working on it" (acceptable excuse)<br />
- Enterprise support contract with SLAs<br />
- Someone else's ass on the line</p>
<p>With Odoo:<br />
- "Our developer is working on it" (why did we hire an idiot?)<br />
- No one to sue if shit breaks<br />
- Your own ass on the line</p>
<h3>2. <strong>The Integration Myth</strong></h3>
<p>Medidis probably has:<br />
- CNC machines for cutting<br />
- Industrial sewing equipment<br />
- Warehouse management systems<br />
- Export documentation software<br />
- Customs integration<br />
- Quality control systems</p>
<p>Cegid sales pitch: "We integrate with everything."</p>
<p>Reality: They integrate with nothing out of the box, but they have certified partners who charge ‚Ç¨50K per integration.</p>
<p>Odoo reality: Most integrations require custom development, but total cost is still less than one Cegid integration.</p>
<p>But which pitch sounds safer in a boardroom?</p>
<h3>3. <strong>The Certification Theater</strong></h3>
<p>Medidis is FSC certified, PEFC certified, ISO 9001 certified. They export globally.</p>
<p>Cegid probably has modules that help maintain compliance, generate audit reports, track certifications.</p>
<p>With Odoo, you'd build this yourself. It's not hard, but when the auditor asks "Show me your certified ERP system," what sounds better:</p>
<ul>
<li>"We use Cegid, an industry-standard solution"</li>
<li>"We use Odoo with custom modules we built"</li>
</ul>
<p>The auditor doesn't care which works better. They care about checking boxes.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>The Export Documentation Nightmare</strong></h3>
<p>Exporting from Morocco to Europe and USA means:<br />
- Customs declarations<br />
- EUR1 certificates<br />
- Bills of lading<br />
- Phytosanitary certificates<br />
- FSC/PEFC chain of custody<br />
- Commercial invoices in multiple currencies</p>
<p>Cegid probably has Morocco-specific modules for this (overpriced as fuck, but they exist).</p>
<p>With Odoo, you're building custom integrations with Moroccan customs systems, PORTNET, banking systems...</p>
<p>Again, not impossible, but requires someone who actually knows what they're doing.</p>
<h2>The Dirty Economics Nobody Talks About</h2>
<p>Let's guess what Medidis paid:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Cegid Implementation: ‚Ç¨300,000-500,000
Annual licenses: ‚Ç¨50,000-100,000
Consultant fees (ongoing): ‚Ç¨30,000-50,000/year
Training: ‚Ç¨20,000

5-year total: ‚Ç¨800,000-1,200,000
</code></pre></div>

<p>With Odoo, realistic costs:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Implementation: ‚Ç¨80,000-150,000
Annual Enterprise: ‚Ç¨15,000
Good developer (retained): ‚Ç¨30,000/year
Training: ‚Ç¨10,000

5-year total: ‚Ç¨250,000-350,000
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>They could save ‚Ç¨500,000-900,000.</strong></p>
<p>But here's why they won't:</p>
<h3>The Money Distribution Problem</h3>
<p>That ‚Ç¨500K for Cegid gets distributed to:<br />
- Prestigious consulting firm (creates relationships)<br />
- Vendor (established player)<br />
- Training companies (more jobs)<br />
- IT staff (bigger budgets to manage)</p>
<p>It keeps a whole ecosystem employed and happy.</p>
<p>That ‚Ç¨150K Odoo solution goes to:<br />
- One or two smart developers<br />
- Small consulting shop<br />
- Less impressive PowerPoints</p>
<p><strong>Fewer stakeholders = fewer people advocating for it.</strong></p>
<h2>What Really Pisses Me Off</h2>
<p>It's not that they chose Cegid. It's the <strong>missed opportunity</strong>.</p>
<p>Medidis could have:<br />
- Built a lean, flexible system<br />
- Trained local developers<br />
- Created a reference case for Moroccan manufacturing<br />
- Saved enough money to invest in new equipment<br />
- Actually contributed to Morocco's tech ecosystem</p>
<p>Instead, they:<br />
- Sent hundreds of thousands of euros to France<br />
- Got locked into expensive licenses<br />
- Probably use 30% of the features they paid for<br />
- Have a system that's harder to customize than it should be</p>
<h2>The Cegid Reality (What They Won't Tell You)</h2>
<p>Here's what probably happened post-implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Months 1-6</strong>: Consultants everywhere, promises of seamless integration</li>
<li><strong>Month 7</strong>: Go-live disaster, production delays, chaos</li>
<li><strong>Month 8-12</strong>: "Fine-tuning" (fixing the clusterfuck)</li>
<li><strong>Year 2</strong>: System kind of works, but everyone hates it</li>
<li><strong>Year 3</strong>: They're back to using Excel for half their stuff</li>
<li><strong>Year 4</strong>: "We need to upgrade to the new version" (more consulting fees)</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, the employees on the floor still use paper and WhatsApp because the system is too slow/complicated/unreliable.</p>
<h2>What You Can Learn From This</h2>
<p>If you're trying to sell Odoo to companies like Medidis, understand:</p>
<p><strong>You're not selling software. You're selling risk reduction.</strong></p>
<p>To win, you need:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Speak Their Language</strong></h3>
<p>Stop talking about "flexibility" and "open source."</p>
<p>Talk about:<br />
- ROI with specific numbers<br />
- Risk mitigation strategies<br />
- Compliance maintenance<br />
- Export documentation<br />
- Production efficiency</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Show Similar Success</strong></h3>
<p>One case study of a furniture manufacturer using Odoo successfully is worth more than 100 features comparisons.</p>
<p>Find one. If you can't find one, <strong>create one</strong>.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Build the Morocco-Specific Modules</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Customs integration (PORTNET)</li>
<li>Moroccan tax compliance</li>
<li>EUR1 certificate generation</li>
<li>BMCE/Attijariwafa banking integration</li>
<li>FSC/PEFC tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>Make these open source. Build credibility.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Partner with Their Consultants</strong></h3>
<p>Don't compete with the big consulting firms. Partner with them.</p>
<p>Offer to be the technical back-end while they do the relationship management.</p>
<p>They get their consulting fees, you get implementation work, client gets better solution.</p>
<h3>5. <strong>Start Smaller</strong></h3>
<p>Don't pitch full ERP replacement to Medidis.</p>
<p>Pitch:<br />
- "Pilot project for one production line"<br />
- "Supplement to existing system"<br />
- "Proof of concept for new factory"</p>
<p>Get your foot in the door.</p>
<h2>The Harsh Truth: Don't Waste Your Time</h2>
<p>Honestly? Companies like Medidis are the <strong>worst</strong> targets for an Odoo consultant.</p>
<p>They're:<br />
- Too big to move fast<br />
- Too bureaucratic to take risks<br />
- Too invested in existing systems<br />
- Too comfortable to change</p>
<p><strong>Better targets:</strong><br />
- New factories being built<br />
- Companies expanding to second location<br />
- Startups scaling from 20 to 100 employees<br />
- Companies whose current system just died<br />
- Owner-operator businesses (single decision-maker)</p>
<h2>What I'd Do Instead</h2>
<p>Forget Medidis. Find the next Medidis.</p>
<p>There are dozens of growing furniture/decoration companies in Morocco:<br />
- 50-150 employees<br />
- Growing fast<br />
- Current systems breaking<br />
- Can't afford Cegid<br />
- Owner still makes decisions</p>
<p>These companies will <strong>love</strong> Odoo because:<br />
- Price matters (it's their money)<br />
- Speed matters (they're growing)<br />
- Flexibility matters (they're changing)<br />
- They actually listen to technical arguments</p>
<p>Build 5 success stories there. Then companies like Medidis will come to you.</p>
<h2>The Real Question</h2>
<p>Why do you care so much that Medidis uses Cegid?</p>
<p>If it's because you want to help them - respect, but they didn't ask.</p>
<p>If it's because you see wasted money - agreed, but it's their money to waste.</p>
<p>If it's because it represents everything wrong with Moroccan business culture - <strong>now we're talking.</strong></p>
<h2>The Bigger Picture: Morocco's Tech Problem</h2>
<p>Medidis using Cegid is a symptom of a larger disease:</p>
<p><strong>Moroccan companies export products but import solutions.</strong></p>
<p>They manufacture for Europe and USA, they're FSC certified, they have modern factories... but they can't imagine using Moroccan technical expertise for their core systems.</p>
<p>The same company that trusts Moroccan engineers to build their factory won't trust Moroccan developers to build their software.</p>
<p>The irony? The Odoo developer you'd hire is probably better than the junior consultant Cegid sends them.</p>
<h2>My Lazy Developer Take</h2>
<p>I wouldn't pitch Odoo to Medidis.</p>
<p>Too much politics, too slow, too many people to convince.</p>
<p>I'd rather:<br />
1. Find 3 mid-size furniture companies<br />
2. Implement Odoo for ‚Ç¨50K each<br />
3. Document everything<br />
4. Create open-source Morocco manufacturing modules<br />
5. Publish case studies</p>
<p>Then let companies like Medidis find me when they realize they overpaid by ‚Ç¨500K.</p>
<h2>What You Should Actually Do</h2>
<p><strong>Short term</strong>: Stop being mad about Medidis. They made their choice.</p>
<p><strong>Medium term</strong>: Build the solution that makes their choice look stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Long term</strong>: Create enough success stories that the next generation of Moroccan manufacturers doesn't even consider Cegid.</p>
<p><strong>The best revenge?</strong></p>
<p>Build an Odoo-based furniture manufacturer that's more efficient, more profitable, and more agile than Medidis.</p>
<p>Then export not just furniture, but the software solution itself.</p>
<p>Let French companies buy Moroccan ERP software for a change.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Want to prove Odoo is better? Stop arguing with bureaucrats. Build something undeniable. Ship a solution so good that choosing Cegid becomes embarrassing.</em></p>
<p><em>Until then, let Medidis pay their French software tax. You go build the future.</em></p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you actually want to change this, here's the play: Find a furniture manufacturer who's pissed off with their current system, implement Odoo for them at cost, document everything obsessively, open-source the Morocco manufacturing modules, and create a case study so compelling that CFOs can't ignore it. That's how you change industries - one proof point at a time.</p>
