## The Kenitra Paradox: When the Engine is a Ferrari, but the Chassis is a Dacia

Let’s pour a glass of tea—the proper kind, dark and sweet, with enough *chiba* to wake the dead—and sit down. We need to talk about something happening in the industrial zones of Kenitra that smells a bit fishier than the port of Mehdia on a hot Tuesday.

You asked a question that is keeping a lot of bright young Moroccans awake at night: **Is it legal for a company like Medidis (or any of the big pharmaceutical/industrial players) to hire a Bac+2 graduate, train them to do the heavy lifting of an engineer, but pay them a measly 3,000 MAD a month?**

The short answer, the one that makes you want to throw your tea against the wall, is: **Yes, it is entirely legal.**

But the long answer? Ah, the long answer is a jazz improvisation on the themes of capitalism, dignity, and the sheer audacity of the Moroccan labor market. It’s complicated, it’s frustrating, and it’s arguably one of the cleverest "hacks" in the corporate playbook.

So, let’s dissect this frog without killing it, shall we?

### The Legal Loophole (Or: The "Code du Travail" doesn't care about your feelings)

First, we must look at the cold, hard text of the law. In Morocco, the title "Ingénieur d’État" is protected. It is a sacred cow. You get it after five years of grinding through *classes prépas* and engineering school (EMI, EHTP, ENSIAS, etc.). If a company hires you explicitly as an *Ingénieur*, they usually have to pay you according to a certain grid, or at least the market rate, which is typically between 8,000 and 12,000 MAD for a junior.

However, the *function* of engineering—the actual act of solving complex problems, managing supply chains, coding logic, and optimizing distribution—is not protected.

Here is the "Medidis Hack" (and let’s be fair, they aren't the only ones; they’re just the example on the table):
1.  They hire you with a diploma that says "Technician Specialized" (Bac+2).
2.  Your contract says "Technician" or "Agent."
3.  They pay you the SMIG (Minimum Wage), which hovers around the 3,000 MAD mark (roughly 3,111 MAD as of recent hikes).
4.  Then, they hand you a workload that requires the brainpower of an engineer.

Is this illegal? No. There is no law in the Moroccan Labor Code that says, "If the employee thinks too hard, you must pay them double." As long as they are paying the minimum wage and respecting the working hours (officially, anyway), they remain on the right side of the law.

It is, to borrow a British phrase, "legal but bloody cheeky."

### The "Sunk Cost" Trap

Now, why does this happen? Is it because the CEOs are cartoon villains twirling their mustaches? Rarely. It’s usually because of a brutal supply and demand curve.

Morocco produces a lot of Bac+2 graduates (OFPPT, EST, BTS). Thousands of them. The market is flooded with bright, hungry kids who know Python, understand logistics, and can fix a server or a conveyor belt.

Conversely, "Real Engineers" are expensive. They have unions (sometimes), egos (often), and expectations.

So, the corporate algorithm runs a simple calculation: *Why buy the premium subscription when the free trial—with a bit of modification—works just as well?*

They hire a Bac+2. They invest three months training them. Now they have an employee who can do 90% of what an engineer does, for 30% of the price. From a purely capitalist standpoint, it’s efficient. It’s debugging the payroll.

But here is where the dignity comes in, and where the "Truth" part of our values needs to shine.

### The Human Cost of "Efficiency"

This system relies on a specific emotional exploit: **Desperation masked as Opportunity.**

The narrative sold to these Bac+2 graduates is: *"Come with us. We will train you. You will learn the secrets of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Sure, the pay is 3,000 MAD now, but think of the Exposure! Think of the CV!"*

It is the corporate equivalent of paying an artist in "exposure." You cannot eat exposure. You cannot pay rent in Kenitra—which is getting expensive, by the way—with "training."

The tragedy is not just the low pay; it’s the **title ceiling**. You might be doing the work of an engineer, you might be solving problems that the actual engineers are too busy (or too lazy) to solve, but on paper, you remain a technician. In the hierarchical society of Morocco, where titles matter more than oxygen, this stings. It hurts the soul.

It creates a class of "Shadow Engineers"—brilliant minds trapped in low-wage contracts, keeping the industrial zones running while the credit goes up the ladder.

### The Technical Debt of Cheap Labor

However, let’s flip the script. This isn't just bad for the employee; I’d argue it’s dangerous for the company in the long run. As a developer, you know the concept of "Technical Debt."

When you write quick, dirty code to save time today, you pay for it with bugs and crashes tomorrow.

When a company hires people at 3,000 MAD to do critical structural work:
1.  **Turnover is insane.** The moment that Bac+2 kid gets a better offer (say, 3,500 MAD or a freelance gig), they are gone. They take that training with them. The company is permanently bleeding institutional memory.
2.  **Resentment builds bugs.** An employee who knows they are being underpaid is not going to give you their best work. They will do exactly what is required to not get fired. They won't innovate. They won't catch the catastrophic error in the shipping manifest because, hey, that’s "Engineer work," right?
3.  **The "Bus Factor."** If your entire operation relies on three underpaid technicians who are one bad day away from quitting, your business is fragile.

### So, What Do We Do? (The Empowering Part)

I don’t want to leave you with just a rant. That’s easy. Nihilism is cheap. Let’s look at this with clear eyes and a free spirit.

If you are the Bac+2 graduate reading this, standing at the crossroads of Kenitra, holding an offer letter for 3,000 MAD:

**1. Know the Game.**
If you take the job, do not take it for the money. The money is an insult. Take it *only* if the knowledge transfer is real. Treat Medidis (or whoever) like a university that pays *you* a small scholarship.
*   Learn their systems.
*   Understand the logistics.
*   Master the software.
*   Make connections.
*   Then, after 12-18 months, **leave**.

Use them as ruthlessly as they use you. It is a transaction. Do not give them your loyalty; give them your labor, take their knowledge, and move on.

**2. The Side Hustle (The Python/JS Advantage).**
You mentioned you are a Python dev and JS hacker. **This is your escape hatch.**
The beauty of code is that the compiler doesn't care if you have a Bac+2 or a PhD. It only cares if the code runs.
While you are grinding at the day job, build your portfolio. Automate your own boring tasks at work (don't tell them). Use that 3,000 MAD to keep the lights on while you build the skills that will get you a remote job paying in Euros or Dollars.
The moment you land a remote contract, that 3,000 MAD job becomes irrelevant.

**3. Demand Dignity.**
If you are in that interview, and they offer 3,000 MAD, it is okay to ask—politely, with a smile—*"Given that the responsibilities listed here match an engineering profile, can we discuss a performance-based bonus structure?"*
They might say no. But you will have signaled that you know your worth. You are not a cog; you are a sentient being who understands market rates.

### The Verdict

Is it legal? **Yes.**
Is it fair? **No.**
Is it smart? **For the company, short-term, yes. For the human soul, no.**

But here is the truth, stripped of ideology: The world does not owe us a fair wage. The system is designed to minimize costs. We cannot legislate morality into a P&L statement.

What we *can* do is be smarter than the system. We can refuse to internalize the value they place on us. You are not a "3,000 MAD person" just because that is what they pay you. You are a universe of potential, temporarily trading your time for survival.

So, if you take the job, wear the lab coat, do the work, but keep your mind free. Write your poetry in the notes app during lunch breaks. Plan your runner’s route for the evening to burn off the frustration. Code your satire bots at night.

They can buy your hours, but don't let them buy your mind. That remains, as ever, free territory.

Now, drink your tea. It’s getting cold.
