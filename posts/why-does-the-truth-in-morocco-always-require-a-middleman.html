            <h1>The Samsar of the Soul: Why Truth in Morocco Always Needs a Middleman</h1>
<p>If you have ever stood in a Moroccan administrative line—clutching a plastic folder containing your birth certificate, two photos on a white background, and the palpable fear of God—you know the feeling. You are not a citizen; you are a supplicant. You are waiting for a stamp, a signature, or a nod from a person behind a glass pane who holds the keys to your existence.</p>
<p>And inevitably, just as you reach the front, you are told you are missing "Document X."</p>
<p>You don’t know what Document X is. The sign on the wall is in French, legalistic and impenetrable. The official looks through you as if you are made of low-quality glass. Panic sets in.</p>
<p>Then, he appears. The <em>Samsar</em> (the broker). Or perhaps a friendly stranger who "knows a guy." Or maybe, later that night, you turn on the radio to hear a loud, confident voice telling you exactly what to do.</p>
<p>In Morocco, the truth is rarely a direct flight; it is a connecting flight with a long layover in confusion. We have built a society where access to reality—whether it’s legal, medical, or spiritual—requires a broker. We don’t just have a market economy; we have an <strong>Intermediary Economy</strong>.</p>
<p>The question is: Why? Why can’t we just… know things?</p>
<h3>The Language of the Gods (and the Colonizers)</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the elephant in the room, shall we? It’s a very large, baguette-eating elephant.</p>
<p>The fundamental disconnect in Morocco is linguistic. We live, love, fight, and bargain in <strong>Darija</strong>. It is a fluid, expressive, jazz-like language, capable of incredible nuance and humor. But the "Official Truth"—the laws, the medical diagnoses, the banking contracts—is written in <strong>French</strong> or a form of Classical Arabic so rigid it feels like it was carved into stone tablets by a bored scribe in the 12th century.</p>
<p>This is not an accident; it is architecture.</p>
<p>When the French Protectorate set up the modern Moroccan administration under Lyautey, the goal wasn’t to empower the natives; it was to manage them. They created a "technocratic elite" separated from the "masses" by a wall of paperwork. The French left in 1956, but they left the wall behind. We just painted it a different color.</p>
<p>By keeping the "User Manual" for society in a language that 60% of the population struggles to fully comprehend, the system creates an artificial scarcity of truth. Information becomes a currency. If I understand the contract and you don’t, I have power over you. I can charge you for the translation.</p>
<p>This is why the doctor often doesn’t explain <em>why</em> you are sick; he just hands you a prescription. To explain is to lower himself to your level. To prescribe is to remain the <em>Master</em>.</p>
<h3>The Rise of the Radio High Priest</h3>
<p>Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does the Moroccan psyche. Into this void step the "Radio Gurus," the social coaches, the Mamoun Mobarak Dribis of the world.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be fair here. It is too easy to dismiss these figures as mere populists. They are doing something the state has failed to do for sixty years: <strong>They are speaking Darija.</strong></p>
<p>When a woman calls a radio station in tears because her husband is cheating or her son is on drugs, and the host answers in her own dialect, referencing her own cultural markers, it feels like a revelation. Finally, someone is translating the chaos of life into something readable.</p>
<p>But there is a danger here, and it’s a subtle one.</p>
<p>When the system is opaque, the person who holds the flashlight looks like a messiah. We stop asking, "Is this advice clinically sound?" or "Is this legal interpretation accurate?" and we start asking, "Does he sound confident?"</p>
<p>We trade the tyranny of the bureaucrat (who ignores us) for the tyranny of the charismatic leader (who entertains us). We are so desperate to be heard that we forget to check the credentials of the person listening. It creates a culture where we trust the <em>Person</em> rather than the <em>Process</em>.</p>
<p>And let’s be honest, it’s a bit lazy of us, isn't it? It’s easier to let a loud man on the radio tell us how to raise our children than to read a book on child psychology. But we can’t entirely blame the citizen. If the book on child psychology is in academic French and costs 300 Dirhams, and the radio is free and in Darija, the market has spoken.</p>
<h3>The Economy of "I Know a Guy"</h3>
<p>This extends beyond media. It’s the <em>Moqaddem</em> (local authority agent) who interprets the zoning laws for you. It’s the parking guard who interprets the traffic laws for you. It’s the notary who interprets the property laws for you.</p>
<p>We pay a "confusion tax" on almost everything.</p>
<p>In the West, or at least in the idealized version of it, institutions function on the principle of <strong>Direct Access</strong>. You go to a website, read the requirements, submit the form, and get the result. The system is the authority.</p>
<p>In Morocco, the system is viewed as a hostile organism that must be charmed, bribed, or outsmarted. You don’t "follow the procedure"; you "find an entrance." And to find the entrance, you need a guide.</p>
<p>This strips people of their dignity. There is a specific kind of humiliation—<em>Hogra</em>—in standing before a counter and realizing you don’t speak the secret language of the person behind it. It makes you feel small. It makes you feel like a guest in your own country.</p>
<p>The <em>Samsar</em>, therefore, sells more than just a service. He sells dignity. He says, "Don’t worry, sit down, have tea. I will deal with the hostile organism for you." He is the buffer between your humanity and the cold, hard machinery of the state.</p>
<h3>The Digital Disruption: From Drought to Flood</h3>
<p>Here is where it gets interesting. The internet has arrived, and it has taken a sledgehammer to the gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the "Middleman Monopoly" is breaking. You can Google your symptoms (though please, don’t assume it’s cancer). You can read the Family Code (Moudawana) online. You can watch a YouTube video explaining how to pay your taxes.</p>
<p>But we have swung from one extreme to the other. We went from having <strong>Zero Information</strong> to having <strong>Infinite Misinformation</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of one Mamoun Mobarak Dribi, we now have ten thousand TikTok "coaches," crypto-experts, and herbal healers. The gate is open, but the garden is full of weeds. We are seeing a democratization of the <em>Samsar</em>. Everyone is now a broker of truth.</p>
<p>This is the chaotic jazz phase of our development. It’s messy, loud, and often wrong. But it’s arguably better than the silence that came before. At least now, we can argue back.</p>
<h3>The Path Forward: Democratizing the Truth</h3>
<p>So, how do we fix this? How do we build a society where truth doesn't require a middleman?</p>
<p>It’s not about banning the radio hosts or arresting the <em>samsars</em>. They are symptoms, not the disease. If you ban the fever, you don't cure the infection.</p>
<p><strong>1. Radical Linguistic Simplification:</strong><br />
We need to stop pretending we are Parisians. Administrative forms, hospital discharge papers, and legal summons should be in plain, accessible language. If a law cannot be understood by a high school graduate, it is a bad law. Clarity is a form of justice.</p>
<p><strong>2. Institutional Humility:</strong><br />
Our experts—doctors, lawyers, professors—need to climb down from their ivory towers. The "Argument from Authority" ("I am the Doctor, silence!") is dead. If you cannot explain your diagnosis to your patient in their mother tongue, you are not a good doctor; you are just a technician with a superiority complex.</p>
<p><strong>3. Critical Thinking as Self-Defense:</strong><br />
We need to teach our children (and ourselves) to audit the brokers. When the radio host screams, we should ask, "Says who?" When the official says "It's forbidden," we should ask, "Show me the text."</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The truth in Morocco requires a middleman because we have accepted the lie that we are not smart enough to handle the truth directly. We have accepted that the "State" is a high castle and we are the peasants in the mud, needing a priest to intercede for us.</p>
<p>It is time to storm the castle—not with pitchforks, but with questions.</p>
<p>We need to realize that the <em>Samsar</em>, the radio guru, and the connection are crutches for a broken leg. The goal shouldn’t be to get a better crutch; the goal should be to heal the leg so we can walk on our own.</p>
<p>The truth is not a secret to be whispered by a chosen few. It is a public utility, like water or electricity. And like water, it should flow directly to the tap, clear, clean, and available to everyone, without anyone standing in the middle holding a bucket and charging admission.</p>
