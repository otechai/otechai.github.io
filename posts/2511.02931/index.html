Support. Like a friendly neighborhood loan shark, except the neighborhood is the entire internet and the “loan” comes with strings attached to your innovation pipeline.\nLet me translate what they found, because this is where it gets properly disturbing.\nThe Shell Game You know how everyone’s been watching big tech acquisitions? Facebook buying Instagram, Microsoft buying LinkedIn, that kind of thing? Turns out we’ve been watching the wrong game entirely.\nGoogle made about 250 acquisitions since 2004. Regulators reviewed exactly four of them. That’s less than two percent. Already concerning, right? But here’s the kicker: while everyone was watching those acquisitions, Google shifted strategies entirely. Between 2010 and 2024, its acquisitions dropped while its investments exploded—from 20 investments in 2010 to over 700 annually by 2022.\nThey call this “venture capital support” and “accelerator programs.” Here’s what that really means: Google identifies promising startups, gives them money or free cloud credits, embeds itself in their operations, shapes their business plans, and creates a galaxy of companies that orbit Google’s interests. No acquisition necessary. No regulatory review triggered.\nThe other big tech companies combined—Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft—invested in about 3,500 companies over this period. Google alone? Nearly 6,000.\nThink about that structure. It’s like comparing a traditional monopoly (one big company dominating a market) to a mafia family (one organization controlling hundreds of seemingly independent businesses). Regulators know how to fight the first one. The second? They’re barely aware it exists.\nThe Original Sin: DoubleClick To understand how we got here, we need to talk about Google’s 2007 acquisition of DoubleClick. This is the Rosetta Stone for understanding everything that followed.\nDoubleClick was an advertising technology company that sat between advertisers and publishers. Before Google bought it, lots of smart people warned regulators: “This is dangerous. Google will use this to monopolize digital advertising.”\nThe Federal Trade Commission and European Commission waved it through. Why? Because they used something called Industrial Organization economics—Chicago School thinking that essentially says vertical mergers (buying companies in different parts of the supply chain) are rarely harmful.\nThe economists said Google would need to meet five extremely specific conditions to abuse this power. The conditions were so narrow, so theoretical, that proving harm became nearly impossible. It’s like designing a murder investigation where you can only convict if the killer used a left-handed screwdriver on a Tuesday during a full moon.\nHere’s what actually happened: Google integrated DoubleClick into its systems, engaged in systematic self-preferencing, and built a monopoly so complete that by 2025, the European Commission fined them €2.95 billion for “favouring its own online display advertising technology services to the detriment of competing providers.”\nTranslation: everyone who warned about this in 2007 was right. The economists were catastrophically wrong.\nThe Fitbit Fiasco You’d think regulators would learn. They didn’t.\nIn 2020, Google bought Fitbit for $2.1 billion. Again, concerns were raised about data privacy and market power. Again, regulators approved it—this time with “behavioral commitments” that were supposed to prevent Google from abusing its new position.\nHere’s what Google promised: they wouldn’t use Fitbit health data for ads, they’d keep APIs open for competitors, they’d play nice with Android integration.\nHere’s what actually happened: Fitbit lost users, generated less revenue, saw device sales plummet. Google launched its own competing Pixel Watch. Fitbit’s web dashboard shut down. The co-founders left. By 2025, Google announced it’s selling Verily, its health data subsidiary, suggesting they never had serious intentions for the health data business anyway.\nThe commitments became irrelevant because the product withered. No one wrote rules against killing what you acquire. The economists had a term for this—“killer acquisitions”—but their theoretical frameworks still couldn’t catch it in practice.\nThe Vertical Power Blind Spot Here’s what makes this so insidious: traditional antitrust thinking focuses on horizontal power—one company dominating a single market. Smartphone makers competing with smartphone makers. Search engines competing with search engines.\nBut digital platforms operate vertically. Google doesn’t just compete in search—it owns the ad exchange, the ad server, the analytics, the browser, the operating system, the cloud infrastructure, and increasingly, the AI models that power everything. It’s the NYSE, Goldman Sachs, and the SEC all rolled into one.\nOne Google official in 2016 compared their position to “Goldman or Citibank owning the NYSE.” They knew exactly what they were building.\nThe Chicago School framework systematically misses this. It’s designed to catch companies that raise prices. But Google gives away most products for free. The harm shows up in data exploitation, innovation suppression, privacy erosion, and the slow strangulation of potential competitors before they ever become threats.\nAn economist would need to prove five cumulative conditions to block a vertical merger. A mafia don just needs to make you an offer you can’t refuse.\nThe Geopolitical Twist Here’s where it gets properly disturbing. Google’s influence has become so vast that it’s essentially merged with U.S. geopolitical interests.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in March 2025: “I go to the heads of Google and Microsoft and Amazon. They’re all for America, building for us.” He’s openly describing a strategy where American tech dominance is a tool of state power.\nGoogle’s former CEO Eric Schmidt chairs government AI committees. The company has embedded itself so deeply in national infrastructure that opposing it feels almost unpatriotic. This creates a doom loop: the more powerful Google becomes, the harder it is to regulate, which makes it more powerful.\nNow they want to acquire Wiz, a $32 billion Israeli cybersecurity company that gives visibility across multiple clouds. If approved, Google would have invasive, real-time access to the internal operations of businesses worldwide. For a company that pioneered “surveillance capitalism,” this should terrify everyone.\nThe Numbers Don’t Lie Let’s zoom out to the full picture:\nBetween 2014-2024, Google’s investments dwarfed every competitor. In 2022 alone, Google invested in 743 companies—more than Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft combined. Most of this came through Google for Startups, which provides funding, cloud credits, and “support” to young companies.\nSupport. That’s the euphemism. What it really means: Google identifies promising innovations early, makes them dependent on Google infrastructure, shapes their business models to align with Google’s interests, and creates a network of nominally independent companies that all feed data and intelligence back to Mountain View.\nThis doesn’t trigger merger reviews. It doesn’t show up in market share calculations. It doesn’t appear in most academic studies of big tech power. But it’s arguably more powerful than any acquisition could be.\nThe researchers analyzed PitchBook data—which tracks private markets better than public market data—and found Google has invested in or supported nearly 6,000 companies since 2010. Not acquired. Invested in. Supported. Influenced. Shaped.\nThat’s not a company. That’s an empire.\nThe Bullshit Detector Let’s be clear about what this paper gets right and where we should be skeptical.\nWhat’s solid: The data on Google’s investment strategy is unprecedented. PitchBook captures transactions that Bloomberg and other public-market trackers miss. The comparison showing Google out-investing all other GAFAM companies combined is striking and appears robust.\nThe critique of Chicago School economics is devastating and well-documented. The DoubleClick and Fitbit case studies show clear regulatory failures where concerns raised in real-time proved prophetic.\nWhere to push back: The paper doesn’t fully distinguish between different types of “support.” Getting free cloud credits is different from receiving equity investment. The 6,000 number lumps these together. How many of those companies are truly dependent versus just opportunistically taking free stuff?\nAlso, the paper is explicitly advocating for policy change (structural remedies, prohibiting mergers). That’s fine—academics should advocate—but readers should know the authors have a position. They want more aggressive antitrust enforcement. I happen to think they’re right, but you should know where they’re coming from.\nThe geopolitical angle, while concerning, relies heavily on one Commerce Secretary quote. More evidence of government-Google alignment would strengthen this section.\nWhat This Actually Means If you’re a startup founder, you probably already feel this. That attractive Google for Startups program? Those “free” cloud credits? They’re not charity. They’re the first link in a chain of dependencies.\nIf you’re concerned about competition, this should radicalize you. Traditional antitrust can’t catch this. The rules were written for Standard Oil and AT\u0026T—horizontal monopolies that raised prices. Google built something different: a vertical empire that gives away products while extracting data, suppressing innovation, and making independent competition structurally impossible.\nIf you’re European (or non-American), this should terrify you. Your digital infrastructure is controlled by an American company that the U.S. government increasingly treats as an instrument of national power. The Trump administration created a “National Energy Dominance Council.” They’re thinking the same way about technology dominance.\nThe researchers end with a call for new analytical tools—using accounting and financial analysis instead of Industrial Organization economics to understand vertical power. They want structural remedies (breaking up companies) instead of behavioral commitments (promising to be good).\nMost importantly, they identify Google’s proposed Wiz acquisition as the test case. Will regulators finally learn from past mistakes? Or will they wave through another deal using the same failed framework?\nThe Wonder Moment Here’s what keeps me up: Google’s strategy is brilliant in a terrifying way. They found the gap between what regulators can see and what actually matters. They shifted from buying companies (visible, regulable) to building dependencies (invisible, everywhere).\nIt’s rather remarkable, actually, how completely they’ve outmaneuvered democratic oversight. Not through corruption or illegality, but through structural innovation in how corporate power operates.\nThe question isn’t whether Google is too powerful. The question is whether we have any institutional capacity left to address power that operates this way.\nI don’t know the answer to that. But I know we’re about to find out.\nRead the Original Google’s hidden empire: New data reveals the company’s unexpected reach and the failure of antitrust authorities wielding Chicago-School economics to address vertical power by Aline Blankertz, Brianna Rock, and Nicholas Shaxson (2025)\n📄 Read it here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02931.pdf\narXiv:2511.02931v1 [cs.CY] 4 Nov 2025\n","wordCount":"1723","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://otechai.github.io/profile.jpg","datePublished":"2025-11-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-11-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Otmane Echaibi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://otechai.github.io/posts/2511.02931/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Otmane Echaibi Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://otechai.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://otechai.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://otechai.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

What it really means: Google identifies promising innovations early, makes them dependent on Google infrastructure, shapes their business models to align with Google&rsquo;s interests, and creates a network of nominally independent companies that all feed data and intelligence back to Mountain View.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t trigger merger reviews. It doesn&rsquo;t show up in market share calculations. It doesn&rsquo;t appear in most academic studies of big tech power. But it&rsquo;s arguably more powerful than any acquisition could be.</p><p>The researchers analyzed PitchBook data—which tracks private markets better than public market data—and found Google has invested in or supported nearly 6,000 companies since 2010. Not acquired. Invested in. Supported. Influenced. Shaped.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not a company. That&rsquo;s an empire.</p><h2 id=the-bullshit-detector>The Bullshit Detector<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-bullshit-detector>#</a></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s be clear about what this paper gets right and where we should be skeptical.</p><p>What&rsquo;s solid: The data on Google&rsquo;s investment strategy is unprecedented. PitchBook captures transactions that Bloomberg and other public-market trackers miss. The comparison showing Google out-investing all other GAFAM companies combined is striking and appears robust.</p><p>The critique of Chicago School economics is devastating and well-documented. The DoubleClick and Fitbit case studies show clear regulatory failures where concerns raised in real-time proved prophetic.</p><p>Where to push back: The paper doesn&rsquo;t fully distinguish between different types of &ldquo;support.&rdquo; Getting free cloud credits is different from receiving equity investment. The 6,000 number lumps these together. How many of those companies are truly dependent versus just opportunistically taking free stuff?</p><p>Also, the paper is explicitly advocating for policy change (structural remedies, prohibiting mergers). That&rsquo;s fine—academics should advocate—but readers should know the authors have a position. They want more aggressive antitrust enforcement. I happen to think they&rsquo;re right, but you should know where they&rsquo;re coming from.</p><p>The geopolitical angle, while concerning, relies heavily on one Commerce Secretary quote. More evidence of government-Google alignment would strengthen this section.</p><h2 id=what-this-actually-means>What This Actually Means<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-this-actually-means>#</a></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re a startup founder, you probably already feel this. That attractive Google for Startups program? Those &ldquo;free&rdquo; cloud credits? They&rsquo;re not charity. They&rsquo;re the first link in a chain of dependencies.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about competition, this should radicalize you. Traditional antitrust can&rsquo;t catch this. The rules were written for Standard Oil and AT&amp;T—horizontal monopolies that raised prices. Google built something different: a vertical empire that gives away products while extracting data, suppressing innovation, and making independent competition structurally impossible.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re European (or non-American), this should terrify you. Your digital infrastructure is controlled by an American company that the U.S. government increasingly treats as an instrument of national power. The Trump administration created a &ldquo;National Energy Dominance Council.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re thinking the same way about technology dominance.</p><p>The researchers end with a call for new analytical tools—using accounting and financial analysis instead of Industrial Organization economics to understand vertical power. They want structural remedies (breaking up companies) instead of behavioral commitments (promising to be good).</p><p>Most importantly, they identify Google&rsquo;s proposed Wiz acquisition as the test case. Will regulators finally learn from past mistakes? Or will they wave through another deal using the same failed framework?</p><h2 id=the-wonder-moment>The Wonder Moment<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-wonder-moment>#</a></h2><p>Here&rsquo;s what keeps me up: Google&rsquo;s strategy is brilliant in a terrifying way. They found the gap between what regulators can see and what actually matters. They shifted from buying companies (visible, regulable) to building dependencies (invisible, everywhere).</p><p>It&rsquo;s rather remarkable, actually, how completely they&rsquo;ve outmaneuvered democratic oversight. Not through corruption or illegality, but through structural innovation in how corporate power operates.</p><p>The question isn&rsquo;t whether Google is too powerful. The question is whether we have any institutional capacity left to address power that operates this way.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that. But I know we&rsquo;re about to find out.</p><hr><h2 id=read-the-original>Read the Original<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#read-the-original>#</a></h2><p><strong>Google&rsquo;s hidden
