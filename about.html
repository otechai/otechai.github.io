            <h2>What This Is</h2>
            <p>This is my personal blog. I write about whatever seems worth thinking through clearly: culture, technology, software, ideas, Morocco, the world, and the systems we live under.</p>
            <p>No niche. No brand. No pretense of objectivity. Just one person trying to think honestly about things that matter, and sharing those thoughts in case they're useful to someone else.</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p class="meta">The short version</p>
                <p>I'm from Sidi Kacem, Morocco. I'm an amateur mathematician and someone who spends too much time thinking about how things work and why they're broken. I learned most of what I know outside formal institutions—from books, papers, open source projects, and making mistakes.</p>
                <p>I don't have impressive credentials. I'm not affiliated with any institution or ideology. I'm just someone trying to think clearly about the world and share what I find in case it helps someone else see things more clearly too.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cv-item">
                <h3>Why I Write</h3>
                <p class="meta">The honest reason</p>
                <p>Because most writing is either too academic to be useful or too dumbed down to be meaningful. Because I'm frustrated with systems that don't serve people. Because writing forces me to think clearly. And because occasionally someone tells me that something I wrote helped them understand something better, and that makes it worthwhile.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="cv-section">
            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>I write like a human being, not a content generator. I have opinions and I defend them with evidence. I admit uncertainty when I'm uncertain. I swear when it's appropriate. I care more about being honest than being polite to institutions that deserve criticism.</p>
            <p>I don't post on a schedule. I write when I have something worth saying. Quality over quantity, substance over noise.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for algorithmic content optimized for engagement, you're in the wrong place. If you want someone to think through ideas honestly and explain them clearly, welcome.</p>
