      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;googles-hidden-empire-when-dont-be-evil-built-6000-tentacles&#34;&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Hidden Empire: When &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Be Evil&amp;rdquo; Built 6,000 Tentacles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a question that should keep you up at night: What if the most powerful company in digital history isn&amp;rsquo;t just buying competitors—it&amp;rsquo;s building an invisible web of dependencies that regulators can&amp;rsquo;t even see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three researchers just dropped a bombshell paper revealing that Google has quietly amassed control over nearly 6,000 companies through investments and &amp;ldquo;support.&amp;rdquo; Not acquisitions. Support. Like a friendly neighborhood loan shark, except the neighborhood is the entire internet and the &amp;ldquo;loan&amp;rdquo; comes with strings attached to your innovation pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Slopaganda: When AI Becomes a Weapon for Your Mind</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;slopaganda-when-ai-becomes-a-weapon-for-your-mind&#34;&gt;Slopaganda: When AI Becomes a Weapon for Your Mind&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what should terrify you: News Corp Australia churns out 3,000 AI-generated &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; news stories every week. Not written by journalists. Generated by algorithms. And they&amp;rsquo;re getting better at lying than humans are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me think about this for a moment. We&amp;rsquo;ve always had propaganda. Goebbels had his radio broadcasts. Napoleon had his pamphlets. The Catholic Church had its missionaries. But something fundamentally different is happening now, and three researchers just mapped out exactly how screwed we might be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
